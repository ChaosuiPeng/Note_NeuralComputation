#  Training a CNN Classifier

we have seen how to define neural networks, compute loss and make updates to the weights of the network.

Now we might be thinking, What about data? 

Generally, when we have to deal with image, text, audio or video data, we can use standard python packages that load data into a numpy array.
Then we can convert this array into a ``torch.*Tensor`` (see [Pytorth Node](https://github.com/ChaosuiPeng/Kaggle_Note/blob/main/Pytorch_Note.md) ).

-  For images, packages such as Pillow, OpenCV are useful
-  For audio, packages such as scipy and librosa
-  For text, either raw Python or Cython based loading, or NLTK and
   SpaCy are useful

Specifically for vision, we have created a package called ``torchvision``, that has data loaders for common datasets such as ImageNet, CIFAR10, MNIST, etc. 
and data transformers for images, viz., ``torchvision.datasets`` and ``torch.utils.data.DataLoader``.

This provides a huge convenience and avoids writing boilerplate code.

For this tutorial, we will use the CIFAR10 dataset.
It has the classes: ‘airplane’, ‘automobile’, ‘bird’, ‘cat’, ‘deer’, ‘dog’, ‘frog’, ‘horse’, ‘ship’, ‘truck’. 
The images in CIFAR-10 are of size 3x32x32, i.e. 3-channel color images of 32x32 pixels in size.

# Training an image classifier

We will do the following steps in order:

1. Load and normalize the CIFAR10 training and test datasets using   ``torchvision``
2. Define a Convolutional Neural Network
3. Define a loss function
4. Train the network on the training data
5. Test the network on the test data

## Load and normalize CIFAR10
```python
import torch
import torchvision
import torchvision.transforms as transforms
```

Using the same method we did in pytorch tutorial, we will take advantage of a GPU if one is available.
```python
device = torch.device("cuda:0" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")
print(f"The current device is {device}")
```

The output of torchvision datasets are PILImage images of range [0, 1].
We transform them to Tensors of normalized range [-1, 1]. 

Since the CIFAR10 images are RGB, they are made up of 3 channels, representing the red, blue and green components of the image. 

The `transforms.Normalize()` function applys a normalising transformation to each channel of the data, the first tuple is a value to be subtracted from each respective channel, and the second tuple gives the value each respective channel will be divided by.  

i.e.:Given `mean = (mean[1],...,mean[n])` and `std = (std[1],..,std[n])` for n channels, this transform will normalize each channel of the input torch.*Tensor: `output[channel] = (input[channel] - mean[channel]) / std[channel]`

```python
transform = transforms.Compose( [ transforms.ToTensor(), transforms.Normalize( (0.5, 0.5, 0.5), (0.5, 0.5, 0.5) ) ] )

batch_size = 4

trainset = torchvision.datasets.CIFAR10(root='./data', train=True, download=True, transform=transform)

trainloader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(trainset, batch_size=batch_size, shuffle=True, num_workers=2)

testset = torchvision.datasets.CIFAR10(root='./data', train=False, download=True, transform=transform)

testloader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(testset, batch_size=batch_size, shuffle=False, num_workers=2)

classes = ('plane', 'car', 'bird', 'cat', 'deer', 'dog', 'frog', 'horse', 'ship', 'truck')
```

we can define a function to show images from data set
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

def imshow(img):
    img = img / 2 + 0.5     # unnormalize
    npimg = img.numpy()
    plt.imshow(np.transpose(npimg, (1, 2, 0)))
    plt.show()
```

randomly select four images with their labels
```python
# get some random training images
dataiter = iter(trainloader)
images, labels = dataiter.next()

# show images
imshow(torchvision.utils.make_grid(images))

# print labels
print(' '.join('%11s' % classes[labels[j]] for j in range(batch_size)))
```

## Define a Convolutional Neural Network
Here we will define the Convolutional Neural Network which we will be using to classify the images. We develop this network using some components you will be familiar with from lectures, consisting of convolutional layers, max pooling layers and fully connected layers. We use the respective pytorch sub-modules seen in the `__init__` definition below. The Pytorch documentation is a good way of seeing what each of these sub modules does. 

For the forward pass of this network we input a 3 channeled image into the neural network, and it outputs a vector of length 10. This vector contains the raw un-normalised scores for each of the 10 classes. Once trained, the class with the highest score will be the predicted class. Understanding what each sub-module in the network is doing is key, so I give a brief overview below:

- `nn.Conv2d(in_channels, out_channels, kernel_size)` - an instance of this sub-module will be a 2 d convolution layer which takes a mini-batch of images with `in_channels` and convolves these images with `out_channels` kernels of height and width `kernel_size` (and `in_channels` depth) to give an output image with `out_channels` many channels. 

- `nn.MaxPool2d(kernel_size)` - an instance of this sub-module will be a 2d maxpooling with a `kernel_size` sized kernel.

- `nn.Linear(in_channels,out_channels)` - was covered in the last tutorial and acts as a fully connected layer between a vector of length `in_features` and a vector of length `out_features`.

These are by no means exhaustive explanations, please refer to the official Pytorch documentation to find out more. The instances of these submodules, which are created in the `__init__` method, are then arranged in the `forward` method of the model to define a forward pass. Note that `F.relu()` functionals are also used in the `forward` method, however are not required to be defined in the `__init__` method, this is the case with any functionals used in the forward sequence of a neural network (one example being most activation functions).

```python
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F

class Net(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(3, 6, 5)  # give an output image with 6 channels, kernel_size 5
        self.pool = nn.MaxPool2d(2, 2)   # with a 2, 2 sized kernel
        self.conv2 = nn.Conv2d(6, 16, 5) # give an output image with 16 channels, kernel_size 5
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(16 * 5 * 5, 120)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(120, 84)
        self.fc3 = nn.Linear(84, 10)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.pool(F.relu(self.conv1(x)))
        x = self.pool(F.relu(self.conv2(x)))
        x = torch.flatten(x, 1) # flatten all dimensions except batch
        x = F.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = F.relu(self.fc2(x))
        x = self.fc3(x)
        return x


net = Net().to(device) # move the model to GPU/cpu
```

## Define a Loss function and optimizer
Let's use a Classification Cross-Entropy loss and SGD with momentum. The `nn.CrossEntropyLoss` only requires the raw un-normalised scores for each class, hence why we don't need a soft-max layer in our network (it is actually built into this loss function). `optim.SGD` allows us to apply minibatch gradient descent with momentum using the hyperparameters below
- learning rate = 0.001
- momentum = 0.9
```python
import torch.optim as optim

criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss() # 回归是均方误差MSE，分类是交叉熵crossentropyloss
optimizer = optim.SGD(net.parameters(), lr =0.001, momentum=0.9)
```

## Train the network
This is when things start to get interesting.
We simply have to loop over our data iterator, and feed the inputs to the network and optimize. 
These lines of code are key to training networks in Pytorch and it is essential you understand how they work. 
They will be similar to those covered in the pytorch tutorial.
```python
for epoch in range(2):  # loop over the dataset multiple times

    running_loss = 0.0
    for i, data in enumerate(trainloader, 0):
        # get the inputs; data is a list of [inputs, labels] and move them to the current device
        inputs, labels = data
        inputs = inputs.to(device)
        labels = labels.to(device)
        
        # zero the parameter gradients
        optimizer.zero_grad()

        # forward + backward + optimize
        outputs = net(inputs)
        loss = criterion(outputs, labels)
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()

        # print statistics - epoch and loss
        running_loss += loss.item()
        if i % 2000 == 1999:    # print every 2000 mini-batches
            print('[%d, %5d] loss: %.3f' %
                  (epoch + 1, i + 1, running_loss / 2000))
            running_loss = 0.0

print('Finished Training')

# save our trained model
PATH = './cifar_net.pth'
torch.save(net.state_dict(), PATH)
```

## Test the network on the test data

We have trained the network for 2 passes over the training dataset.
But we need to check if the network has learnt anything at all.

We will check this by predicting the class label that the neural network outputs, and checking it against the ground-truth. 
If the prediction is correct, we add the sample to the list of correct predictions.

Okay, first step. Let us display a mini-batch of images from the test set to get familiar.

```python
dataiter = iter(testloader)
images, labels = dataiter.next() #Selects a mini-batch and its labels

# print images
imshow(torchvision.utils.make_grid(images))
print('GroundTruth: ', ' '.join('%5s' % classes[labels[j]] for j in range(4)))
```

Next, let's load back in our saved model (note: saving and re-loading the model wasn't necessary here, we only did it to illustrate how to do so):
```python
net = Net()
net.load_state_dict(torch.load(PATH))
```

let us see what the neural network thinks these examples above are.
```python
images = images.to(device)
labels = labels.to(device)

#Assign the output of the neural network to the below variable.
net.cuda()
outputs = net(images)
```

The outputs are energies for the 10 classes.
The higher the energy for a class, the more the network thinks that the image is of the particular class.
So, let's get the index of the highest energy.
```python
_, predicted = torch.max(outputs, 1) #Returns a tuple (max,max indicies), we only need the max indicies.

print('Predicted: ', ' '.join('%5s' % classes[predicted[j]]
                              for j in range(4)))
```

Let us look at how the network performs on the whole dataset. 
Below we keep track of the total numnber of predictions made by our network in the variable `total` and the number of correct predictions made by our network in the variable `correct`. 
This allows us to calculate the proportion of correct predictions the network makes. 
```python
correct = 0
total = 0
# since we're not training, we don't need to calculate the gradients for our outputs
with torch.no_grad():
    for data in testloader:
        images, labels = data
        images = images.to(device)
        labels = labels.to(device)

        # calculate outputs by running images through the network 
        outputs = net(images)
        
        # the class with the highest energy is what we choose as prediction
        _, predicted = torch.max(outputs.data, 1)
        
        # total should store the cumulative number of predictions made by the network 
        # correct should do the same only for correct predictions made by the network
        total += labels.size(0)
        correct += (predicted == labels).sum().item()

print('Accuracy of the network on the 10000 test images: %d %%' % (100 * correct / total))
```

That looks way better than chance, which is 10% accuracy (randomly picking a class out of 10 classes).
It seems like the network learnt something.

Hmmm, what are the classes that performed well, and the classes that did not perform well. 
This can be some useful analysis to carry out as it can show you the limits of your neural network, and they are often areas where the network could be improved. 
```python
# prepare to count predictions for each class
correct_pred = {classname: 0 for classname in classes}
total_pred = {classname: 0 for classname in classes}

# again no gradients needed
with torch.no_grad():
    for data in testloader:
        images, labels = data
        images = images.to(device)
        labels = labels.to(device)
            
        outputs = net(images)    
        _, predictions = torch.max(outputs, 1)
        # collect the correct predictions for each class
        for label, prediction in zip(labels, predictions):
            if label == prediction:
                correct_pred[classes[label]] += 1
            total_pred[classes[label]] += 1

# print accuracy for each class
for classname, correct_count in correct_pred.items():
    accuracy = 100 * float(correct_count) / total_pred[classname]
    print("Accuracy for class {:5s} is: {:.1f} %".format(classname,  accuracy))
```

So now we have trained a convolutional neural nework to perform an image classification task, potentially on a GPU.
